# ETF-Java
A Java parser/writer for the ETF format.

This api aims to provide a set of high-speed abstractions for ETF. 

Currently, its primary goal is to support the subset of ETF utilized by Discord (see: [Loqui](https://github.com/discord/loqui) and [erlpack](https://github.com/discord/erlpack))
